- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @binayab (Binaya Bajgain)

- I just completed my master's in Physics from University of Minnesota and currently looking for Data Analytics and/or Data Scientist roles. During my master's degree, I got myself interested in Data Analytics through my research and extra courses I took in Coursera, Kaggle, hackerrank and more. In December, I completed the Google Data Analytical Professional Certificate and currently I am working with few datasets in the kaggle while completing the Advanced SQL and Deep Learning courses. 

- ðŸ‘€ Working in High Energy Experiment group, I got opportunities to manage and analyze huge datasets while utilizing the physics and statistical knowledge. I am proficient in python, C++ and SQL. 
- Last year I took Machine Learning Fundamentals (CSCI 5525) which helped me get a deeper understanding of the various ML algorithms. Working on the assignments and exams made me capable of not only using the available ML algorithms but write them from a scratch. I have uploaded couple of them in the repository - Machine Learning Algorithm. 
- In my last semester, I took the Data Visualization (MABA 6341) class and was able to use Tableau and R to visualize the data, answer the questions related to the dataset and share the story by designing dashboards. 
- Similarly, from my Advanced Time Series (MABA 6341) class, I got to use R to learn about the time series data where I was able to Analyze time-series data; Understand its components including trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation; Interpret stationarity and the dependency structure and finally Forecast future values.
- And from the Machine Learning Fundamental class, I got a deeper
