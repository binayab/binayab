- 👋 Hi, I’m @binayab (Binaya Bajgain)

- I just completed my master's in Physics from University of Minnesota and currently looking for Data Analytics and/or Data Scientist roles. 

- 👀 Working in High Energy Experiment group, I got opportunites to manage and analyze huge datasets while utilizing the physics and statistical knowledge. I am proficient in python, C++ and SQL. 
- In my last semester, I took the Data Visualization class and was able to use Tableau and R to visualize the data, answer the questions relaetd to the dataset and share the story by designing dashboards. 
- Similarly, from my Advanced Time Series class, I got to use R to learn about the time series data where I was able to Analyze time-series data; Understand its components including trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation; Interpret stationarity and the dependency structure and finally Forecast future values.
- And from the Machine Learning Fundamental class, I got a deeper understanding of the various ML algorithms. Working on the assignments and exams made me capable of not only using the available ML algorithms but write them from a scratch. I have uploaded couple of them in the repository - Machine Learning Algorithm. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced SQL and Deep Learning.
