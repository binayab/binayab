- 👋 Hi, I’m @binayab (Binaya Bajgain)

- I just completed my master's in Physics from University of Minnesota and currently looking for Data Analytics and/or Data Scientist roles. During my master's degree, I got myself interested in Data Analytics through my research and extra courses I took in Coursera, Kaggle, hackerrank and more. In December, I completed the Google Data Analytical Professional Certificate and currently I am working with few datasets in the kaggle while completing the Advanced SQL and Deep Learning courses and solving numerous problems using SQL in hackerank.com. 

- 👀 Working in High Energy Experiment group, I got opportunities to manage and analyze huge datasets while utilizing the physics and statistical knowledge. I was one of the lucky ones to be able to attend the CMS Data Analysis School in January 2020 organized by LHC Physics Center, Fermilab. During two weeks of school, I learned to use the ROOT, Python and C++ to construct and study event selection of the two top quarks and multiple jets that decay leptonically. We were working as a group on the project and gave a presentation at the end that got us awarded the Second place. Spring and summer of 2021, I worked on characterizing the ADC in the lpGBT chip where I wrote python scripts to automate the process of sending voltage signal from Data Acquisition Unit to ADC and reading out the ADC value. The chip was connected to raspberry pi and both pi and data acquisition unit was connected to the local network.

- Last year I took Machine Learning Fundamentals (CSCI 5525) which helped me get a deeper understanding of the various ML algorithms. Working on the assignments and exams made me capable of not only using the available ML algorithms but write them from a scratch. I have uploaded couple of them in the repository - Machine Learning Algorithm. 

- In Fall 2021, I took the Data Visualization (MABA 6341) class and was able to use Tableau and R to visualize the data, answer the questions related to the dataset and share the story by designing dashboards. I have shared couple of Dashboards from the projects I completed in the semester in the repository titled - "Dashboarding with Tableau". 

- Similarly, from my Advanced Time Series (MABA 6341) class, I got to use R to learn about the time series data where I was able to Analyze time-series data; Understand its components including trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation; Interpret stationarity and the dependency structure and finally Forecast future values. I will be uploading some of my time series analysis in a new repository.
